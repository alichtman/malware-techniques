## Malware Anti-Analysis

This suite of tests is intended to detect anything that would indicate a reverse engineer is analyzing this code. It is multi-platform (mainly `macOS` and `Linux`) and multi-language (mainly `C` and `Python`).

Think of it like [Al-Khaser](https://github.com/LordNoteworthy/al-khaser), but not limited to Windows.
