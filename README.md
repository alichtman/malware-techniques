This collection of programs to demonstrate techniques employed by malware to accomplish core tasks.

It's like [Al-Khaser](https://github.com/LordNoteworthy/al-khaser), except focused on `macOS` and `Linux`.

### Catalog

- Anti-VM
- Anti-Autoanalysis
- Anti-Debug
- Anti-Reverse Engineering
- Persistence

### Implementation

These programs are written in a mix of languages. Currently, the library uses:

- `Python`
- `C`
- `x86`
- `Objective-C`

### Building and Running

Each program is meant to be run independently. There is no `main.{c,py}`. Typically, each program written in `C` can be compiled with `$ gcc FILE -o OUTPUT_FILE`.

The only exceptions to this are:

- `src/anti-vm/cross-platform/vmware_detect_with_asm.c`, which uses `cmake` for compilation. Instructions can be found in `src/anti-vm/cross-platform/README.md`.
- `src/anti-autoanalysis/macOS/detectUserActivity`, which uses `clang` for compilation. Instructions can be found in `src/anti-autoanalysis/macOS/detectUserActivity/README.md`

### Motivation

You can read about the motivation behind this project in this [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FjnEkCz4cZghtZbn7i9o8X_9fAwUFjIEjv0LaFlopyk/edit?usp=sharing) I gave.
