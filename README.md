This collection of short programs demonstrates techniques employed by malware to accomplish core tasks. Most of these programs target `macOS` or `Linux`, and are written in either `C` or `Python`.

It's like [Al-Khaser](https://github.com/LordNoteworthy/al-khaser), except focused on `macOS` and `Linux`.

### Catalog

- Anti-VM
- Anti-Autoanalysis
- Anti-Debug
- Anti-Reverse Engineering
- Persistence

### Building and Running

Each program is meant to be run independently. There is no `main.{c,py}`. Each program written in `C` will be compilable with `gcc`. Simply run `$ gcc FILE -o OUTPUT_FILE`.

The only exception to this is the `vmware_detect_with_asm.c` file, which relies on `cmake` for compilation. Instructions for building this can be found in `src/anti-vm/cross-platform/README.md`.

### Motivation

You can read about the motivation behind this project in this [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FjnEkCz4cZghtZbn7i9o8X_9fAwUFjIEjv0LaFlopyk/edit?usp=sharing) I put together.

### Acknowledgements

Thank you to all the security researchers that made this project possible. It's impossible to include everyone here, but I tried my best to include all of the primary sources I used.
